# Simulator panes

cmux can host one booted iPhone or iPad Simulator in a native pane. The pane renders live Simulator frames, forwards input, and exposes device tools without a browser server.

Create a pane from File > New Simulator Pane, the command palette, or the CLI:

```sh
cmux new-surface --type simulator --pane pane:1 --focus true
```

Choose an installed iPhone or iPad from the pane toolbar. cmux remembers its device identifier. If that identifier disappears, restoration requires an explicit device selection; saved runtime and device-type fields are descriptive metadata only.

## Input

- Click or drag inside the screen for taps, swipes, and drags.
- Hold Option while dragging for a two-finger pinch.
- Hold Option and Shift while dragging for a parallel two-finger pan.
- Use a mouse wheel or trackpad to send a paced touch scroll.
- Type with the physical keyboard. cmux forwards mapped keys and modifier chords.
- Use the rendered device buttons or Tools for Home, app switcher, Lock, Siri, and side-button input.
- Rotate from the toolbar or Tools. Input coordinates follow the displayed orientation.

The CLI uses normalized coordinates from `0` to `1`:

```sh
cmux simulator tap 0.5 0.5 --surface surface:1
cmux simulator tap --label General --role Button --surface surface:1
cmux simulator tap --identifier com.example.continue --surface surface:1
cmux simulator swipe 0.5 0.8 0.5 0.2 12 --surface surface:1
cmux simulator button home --surface surface:1
cmux simulator rotate landscape_left --surface surface:1
cmux simulator type 'Hello from cmux' --surface surface:1
```

Accessibility taps match one visible, enabled element by exact label or identifier, then tap its center. Add `--identifier` or `--role` when a label matches multiple elements.

`cmux ios` accepts every Simulator command. For stateful automation, capture a compact accessibility snapshot and use the opaque refs it returns. This example selects the Settings button ref from the JSON snapshot:

```sh
REF="$(cmux ios snapshot --surface surface:1 --json | jq -r '.elements[] | select(.identifier == "settings.general") | .ref')"
cmux ios tap --ref "$REF" --surface surface:1 --json
cmux ios wait exists --label About --role cell --surface surface:1
cmux ios swipe --ref "$SCROLL_REF" up --duration 0.4 --surface surface:1
cmux ios drag --ref "$DRAG_REF" right --surface surface:1
cmux ios long-press --ref "$PRESS_REF" 750 --surface surface:1
cmux ios type --ref "$TEXT_REF" 'Search text' --replace-existing --surface surface:1
cmux ios key 40 --surface surface:1
cmux ios keys 40,42 --delay 0.05 --surface surface:1
cmux ios gesture-preset swipe-from-left-edge --surface surface:1
cmux ios button apple-pay --surface surface:1
```

Snapshots include normalized roles, visible state, supported actions, a sequence number, and a screen hash. Pass `--since-screen-hash` to avoid retransmitting an unchanged tree. Refs belong to one pane session and snapshot, expire after 60 seconds, and are invalidated by input or other UI mutations. Each ref action verifies that the screen hash still matches after its pre-action delay and before sending coordinate input, so app-driven changes fail with `UI_STATE_CHANGED` instead of tapping stale geometry. Successful JSON action results include the resolved action, a refreshed settled snapshot, and whether the screen hash changed.

Wait predicates are `exists`, `gone`, `enabled`, `focused`, `text-contains`, and `settled`. Select by ref or exact `--identifier`, `--label`, `--role`, and `--value` fields. Do not combine a ref with those selector fields. A ref-based wait requires the source element to have an exact runtime identifier and reuses only that identifier while polling.

JSON failures include a machine-readable `ui_error` with an uppercase code, a recovery hint, and relevant refs, candidates, snapshot age, or timeout. Candidate lists are capped at 64 elements. Partial-text waits fail as ambiguous when matching elements contain different visible strings.

Batch taps resolve every ref against one snapshot and revalidate that snapshot before each tap:

```sh
cmux ios batch '[
  {"action":"tap","elementRef":"REF_FROM_SNAPSHOT_1"},
  {"action":"tap","elementRef":"REF_FROM_SNAPSHOT_2","postDelay":0.2}
]' --surface surface:1 --json
```

Use `touch --ref "$REF" --down` and `touch --ref "$REF" --up` for explicit touch phases. `--delay` is accepted only with both `--down` and `--up`. Named gestures support screen scrolling and swipes from each edge.

Each live Simulator surface renders a Sky-kite cursor at screen center before the first programmatic action. The cursor marks held touches, follows timed gestures with distance-based easing, pulses when a touch is released, and remains at the last agent touch point between actions. Its state belongs to the pane coordinator, survives renderer reattachment and non-pointer actions, and resets when the selected device changes or the pane closes, so an action in one workspace cannot draw over another workspace or the desktop.

Run `cmux simulator` for gesture JSON, two-finger input, camera, permission, accessibility, Core Animation, and Web Inspector command syntax.

## Tools

The native Tools panel provides these device controls:

- Apps and media: list, install, launch, terminate, open URLs, add photos or videos, and read or write the pasteboard.
- Device state: rotate, send a memory warning, control the software keyboard, override the status bar, and change appearance or accessibility settings.
- Core Animation: show blended layers, copied images, misaligned images, offscreen rendering, or slow animations.
- Location: set a coordinate or replay built-in routes at walking, running, cycling, or driving speed with pause, loop, and restoration.
- Permissions: inspect, grant, revoke, or reset public and supported private permissions, including push notifications.
- Capture: save screenshots, record video, capture recent logs, or stream bounded live logs.
- Camera: inject an animated placeholder, image, looping video, or host camera into a user app. Sources and mirror mode can change without relaunching the app.
- Inspection: show the foreground app, browse and highlight the native accessibility tree, and send raw Web Inspector commands to Safari or `WKWebView` targets.
- Activity: review the bounded event history for the selected device.

These controls cover the iPhone and iPad device capabilities in [serve-sim](https://github.com/EvanBacon/serve-sim). Browser streaming, browser DevTools presentation, tunneling, Apple Watch, and attach-all fleet controls are outside the pane's scope.

## Crash containment

Private CoreSimulator, SimulatorKit, Indigo, HID, accessibility, camera, and Web Inspector work runs in a supervised child process. The worker resolves framebuffer GPU synchronization and writes a permission-restricted packed-BGRA ring. cmux copies stable slots off-main into immutable images and never gives Core Animation worker-owned storage.

The first worker crash restarts the selected device session. A second consecutive crash trips a fuse and leaves cmux responsive with the last safe frame. Use Recover in the pane or call the recovery RPC to start a fresh session:

```sh
cmux rpc simulator.recover '{"surface_id":"surface:1"}'
```

Recovery completes only after the replacement worker reports a live frame stream. Closing the pane joins pending cleanup, releases held input, stops capture helpers, and removes its shared-memory names.
